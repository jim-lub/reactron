# Reactron: An Electron + React extension
```
Note: Reactron is still in an early development stage and therefor not fit for production.
```

The Reactron project is an attempt to simplify the creation of Desktop applications
by creating an "extended" boilerplate. At it's source it provides a basic *electron*,
*react*, and *webpack* configuration, but Reactron gives you more:

- Write your code in Typescript OR Javascript.
- Development Tools
- Default Components
- Default styling (*Easily customizable by modifying root .scss files*)
- Clients
  - **windowClient**: Open, close, minimize, maximize, position windows from anywhere
  - **storeClient**: Manage state in the main process and access it from anywhere
  - **fileClient**: Read, write, update files on the filesystem
- Open Source code: *Modify / extend Reactron's source code*
